After learning more about BEM I am convinced: the method really has its merits. It is mostly useful in the context of a large scale web application with a lot of components.'

Architectural problems, on the other hand, can cripple development. I can remember distinct cases where we postponed developing a new feature because we were too afraid to make any changes to the CSS.'
